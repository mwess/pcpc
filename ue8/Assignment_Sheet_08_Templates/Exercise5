What does #pragma parallel for do?
=> runs the following code in several threads (number defined by system, can be changed by "export ...")

What is the problem of data or loop dependence?
=> Cant be parallelized because we need the newly calculated data for further calculations

Run the parallel for directive with more than 1 thread. What might go wrong?
=> its possible to read values that has not been set yet

How can you fix this without modifying the computation logic, i.e. using OpenMP fea-
tures?
=> change execution to "pragma omp ordered"


Modify the program logic such that the program behaves correctly with multiple
threads. Use the schedule clause to show how the iterations are divided among
threads.
=> its not possible to change the logic completely and to parallelize the computation of fact because of the dependence of the results
