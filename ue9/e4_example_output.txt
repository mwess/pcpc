1) Each process prints the position of its sailor at every time step.
2) The process of rank 0 shall print the position of every sailor in every time step.

For 3 sailors these two versions might look like

# Time Sailor Position
1 1 26
1 2 43
1 3 23

2 1 25
2 2 45
2 3 15
...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) The process of rank 0 shall print the position of all sailors in the end. First the timeline of all steps from sailor 1, then all steps from sailor 2â€¦
4) Each process shall print all positions of its sailor in a timeline at the end of the simulation. Make sure that only one process prints the timeline at a time.

And again for 3 sailors these two might look like

# Time Sailor Positon
1 1 26
2 1 25

1 2 43
2 2 45

1 3 15
2 3 23
...
